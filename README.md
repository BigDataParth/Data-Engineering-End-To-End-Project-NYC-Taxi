# Data-Engineering-End-To-End-Project-NYC-Taxi 🚖

This project focuses on processing NYC taxi data using Azure services, following the Medallion Architecture. The data is fetched via an API and ingested into an Azure Storage Account, then transformed in Databricks. Azure Data Factory orchestrates the ETL pipeline, ensuring efficient data processing. The cleaned and structured data is then loaded into Power BI for insightful visualizations. This project showcases a scalable data pipeline with cloud-based data engineering best practices. 🚀
